Quantum C&S believes in the value of open source and will be a part of contributing to the development of the open source ecosystem.
Quantum Cloud is custom-built to meet customer needs, using a base constructed from the open source cloud solutions Openstack, Kubernetes, and Ceph. Depending on its purpose, it can be configured into either the QCS (Openstack + Kubernetes + Ceph) or QKS (Kubernetes + Ceph) services.

In addition to Quantum Cloud, Quantum C&S offers QMS, an MSA development solution, and plans to release Samanda, a service that provides tailor-made AI, in the future.
